# SQL_Project_Music_Store_Analysis
SQL project to analyze online music store data

In this project, I analyzed a music playlist database using SQL. The goal was to derive insights that could help a music store understand its business growth. By writing and executing simple SQL queries, I explored various aspects of the dataset such as top-selling tracks, popular genres, customer behavior, and revenue patterns. 

## Database and Tools
